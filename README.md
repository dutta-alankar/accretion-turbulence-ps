Turbulence power spectrum due to accretion of CGM gas by galactic disk

This is a code which tries to reproduce the work outlined in: ```Gas accretion onto galaxies and Kelvin-Helmholtz turbulence (ArXiv: 2207.08685)```
This predicts a power law in velocity power spectrum of with slope of around -1 at scales of around 8 kpc. This can serve as an indirect probe of accretion of CGM onto galactic disk. However, another work ```Turbulent universal galactic Kolmogorov velocity cascade over 6 decades (ArXiv: 2204.13760)``` reports an observed power spectrum slope close to Kolmogorov in a large range of scales. It would pehaps be interesting to study these two work together more closely.
